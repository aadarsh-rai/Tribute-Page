            <li>“Those who cannot acknowledge themselves, will eventually fail.”</li>
            <li>“In order to survive, we cling to all we know and understand.”</li>
            <li>“True change cannot be made if it is bound by laws and limitations, predictions and imagination.”</li>
            <li>“You focus on the trivial, and lose sight of what is most important, Change is impossible in this fog of ignorance.”</li>
            <li>“No matter how powerful you become, don’t try to shoulder everything alone. If you do, You Will Surely Fail.”</li>
            <li>“Loneliness is this world’s worst kind of pain.”</li>
            <li>“It is foolish to fear what we have yet to see and know.”</li>
            <li>“If you want to know who you are, you have to look at your real self and acknowledge what you see.”</li>
            <li>“Teachings that do not speak of pain have no meaning, for humankind cannot gain anything in return.”</li>
            <li>“How can we evolve when regulation is all we know?”</li>
            <li>“At this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony Shinobi’s blessing. But because I’m enlightened by my intelligence.”</li>
